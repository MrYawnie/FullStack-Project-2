# Project Overview

This project was part of a FullStack course where the task was to build a custom REST API and provide it as an Express web application. Additionally, a secondary goal was to create a simple visual interface for the API. 

## General Information

While exploring baby strollers and their availability, I noticed that existing price comparison websites like PriceGrabber or PriceRunner didn't provide much data from common baby stores like Baby Depot, Baby Haven, etc. Therefore, I decided to build my own price tracking service to automate the process of fetching prices.

## Technologies Used

### Express.js
The server is built using Express.js, with dynamic routes as well as traditional ones like `:id`, `/add`, and `/delete`.

### MongoDB
MongoDB was chosen as the database due to familiarity and its compatibility with the course material.

### Next.js
For the front end, Next.js with TypeScript was used to offer efficient web page generation.

### Shadcn/ui
Instead of Bootstrap, I opted for Shadcn/ui for its customizable components, providing tools to create a unique component library.

## Design and Structure

The site's design aims for clarity and functionality. Data can be viewed either in a visual card layout or a sortable table format.

## Evaluation and Learning

I consider this project a success as it allowed me to apply previously acquired knowledge and learn new tools such as Next.js and MongoDB. I would rate myself 10/10 for exceeding project requirements.

## Feedback

The course has been comprehensive, offering enough material for further self-study. I appreciate the presentation of various technologies and the encouragement to learn them.
